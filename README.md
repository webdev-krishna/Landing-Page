# Landing-Page
The following is the single landing page which contains the header, dummy text and image boxes to display, the preference or the author section, a special signup section and lastly a footer.

The css file i have here used is "style1.css"
I wanna use "style.css" to remodel the Landing-page which is displayed using the " "index.html" and "style1.css" ".
